# Reflection: Design Thinking Project

### 1. Project Overview
[cite_start]Design Thinking is a critical thinking process used to develop solutions through collaboration and innovation[cite: 241]. Our team worked on a project to solve [INSERT YOUR PROBLEM NAME HERE, e.g., "Student Time Management"].

### 2. The Process
We followed the 5 key phases of Design Thinking:
1.  **Empathy:** We conducted interviews to understand the user's needs and pain points.
2.  **Define:** We created a problem statement to clarify the core issue.
3.  **Ideate:** We brainstormed multiple creative solutions.
4.  **Prototype:** We built a low-fidelity model of our solution.
5.  **Test:** We gathered feedback to improve the design.

### 3. Personal Reflection
* **My Goal:** My dream is to become a software developer who creates user-friendly applications.
* **Impact:** This project taught me that "coding comes last." Understanding the *user* (Empathy) is the most important step. It changed my perspective from just "building features" to "solving problems."
* **Improvement:** In the future, I want to improve my prototyping skills using tools like Figma to create more realistic mockups before coding.
