# Reflection: Industrial Visit (Johor Port)
**Date:** 08 January 2026
**Location:** Johor Port, Pasir Gudang

### 1. Visit Overview
Our class visited Johor Port to observe the integration of technology in logistics and supply chain management. Johor Port is a multi-purpose port that handles bulk, liquid, and container cargo, serving as a key economic hub for the region.

### 2. Key Learnings
* **Port Operations:** We learned how the port manages the massive flow of goods using specialized Terminal Operating Systems (TOS). This software tracks containers in real-time, ensuring efficient loading and unloading.
* **IT Integration:** The visit highlighted the importance of IT infrastructure in logistics. From gate automation to crane scheduling, every step relies on data synchronization to prevent bottlenecks.
* **Supply Chain Efficiency:** I understood how critical ports are in the global supply chain. Any system downtime can cause major delays, emphasizing the need for robust network security and system reliability.

### 3. Personal Reflection
* **Impact:** This visit bridged the gap between classroom theory and real-world application. Seeing the scale of operations made me appreciate the complexity of "backend" systems that power global trade.
* **Career Insight:** It opened my mind to career opportunities in **Logistics IT** and **Systems Engineering**, showing that computer science is vital even in non-traditional tech sectors like shipping.
