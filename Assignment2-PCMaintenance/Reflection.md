# Reflection: PC Maintenance & Assembly
**Date:** 11 November 2025
**Activity:** Hands-on Lab Session

### 1. Activity Overview
In this lab session, we were tasked with disassembling and reassembling a Personal Computer (PC). The goal was to understand the internal architecture and hardware components of a standard computer system.

### 2. What I Learned
* **Hardware Identification:** I learned to physically identify and handle key components like the CPU (Central Processing Unit), RAM (Random Access Memory), Motherboard, Power Supply Unit (PSU), and Hard Drives.
* **Safety First:** I learned the importance of grounding and safety precautions to prevent Static Electricity (ESD) from damaging sensitive components.
* **Cable Management:** I realized that proper cabling is not just for aesthetics but is crucial for airflow and cooling.

### 3. Personal Reflection
* **Confidence Boost:** Before this, I was hesitant to touch the internals of a computer. This hands-on experience gave me the confidence to troubleshoot and upgrade my own PC in the future.
* **Theory into Practice:** Seeing the physical connections helped me understand the theoretical concepts of "Input-Process-Output" we learned in lectures.
